User Prompt: google drive api to get files to my local machine and just interact with my drive files

Got it! If you're looking to interact with Google Drive using a **command-line interface (CLI)** instead of a desktop app, you can still follow a similar process, but with a few modifications to use the command line for authentication. 

Hereâ€™s how you can set up and use the **Google Drive API** in a **CLI-based Python application**.

### Step 1: Set up Google Drive API and Obtain Credentials
1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on "Select Project" and then "New Project."
   - Give your project a name and create it.
3. **Enable Google Drive API**:
   - In the "APIs & Services" dashboard, click "Enable APIs and Services."
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it.
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to "Credentials" from the left sidebar.
   - Click "Create Credentials" and choose "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs."
   - Configure the consent screen with the required information.
   - Under the "Application type," select **Other** (or "Desktop app," but it will still work with CLI).
   - Download the `client_secret.json` file and save it to your project folder.

### Step 2: Install Required Python Libraries
Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

### Step 3: Authenticate and Set Up CLI for Google Drive Interaction

Use the following Python script to interact with Google Drive from the command line:

1. **Authenticate and Initialize the Google Drive API**:

```python
import os
import io
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaIoBaseDownload

# Scopes for accessing Google Drive
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']

def authenticate_drive_api():
    creds = None
    # Check if token.json already exists, which stores the user's access and refresh tokens
    if os.path.exists('token.json'):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)
    # If no valid credentials exist, let the user log in via the command line
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('client_secret.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_console()  # Use run_console() for CLI
        # Save the credentials to token.json for future use
        with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    
    # Build the Google Drive service
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)
    return service

service = authenticate_drive_api()
```

2. **List Files on Google Drive**:

```python
def list_files(service, page_size=10):
    # Call the Drive API to list the first 10 files
    results = service.files().list(
        pageSize=page_size, fields="nextPageToken, files(id, name)").execute()
    items = results.get('files', [])

    if not items:
        print('No files found.')
    else:
        print('Files:')
        for item in items:
            print(f'{item["name"]} ({item["id"]})')

list_files(service)
```

3. **Download Files from Google Drive**:

```python
def download_file(service, file_id, file_name):
    request = service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
    fh = io.FileIO(file_name, 'wb')

    downloader = MediaIoBaseDownload(fh, request)
    done = False
    while not done:
        status, done = downloader.next_chunk()
        print(f"Download {int(status.progress() * 100)}% complete.")

# Example: Download a file by specifying its ID and desired local filename
file_id = 'your_file_id_here'  # Replace with the actual file ID
file_name = 'your_local_filename_here'  # Specify the name to save the file as
download_file(service, file_id, file_name)
```

### Step 4: Running the Script from CLI
1. **Initial Authentication**:
   - The first time you run the script, it will prompt you to visit a URL and authenticate your Google account via a browser.
   - After granting permission, you will get a code which you paste into the terminal, and the authentication will be completed.
   - The credentials will be saved to `token.json`, so future runs of the script won't require authentication unless the token expires.

2. **Command to Run the Script**:
   - You can run the script directly in your terminal like this:
     ```bash
     python download_files.py
     ```

### Summary of Workflow:
- You run the Python script from the terminal.
- The script uses `InstalledAppFlow().run_console()` to handle authentication via the command line.
- After authenticating, the script can list files and download them using their file ID.

This approach should meet your needs for a command-line based interaction with Google Drive. Let me know if you need further assistance!
